HOW MAKE STANDALONE EXE
To make a runnable jar file, you also need to create a Manifest File (MANIFEST.MF). For example:

Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: JarExample

//note that you have to hit return after "JarExample" ie have a blank line

Place the compiled output class files (JarExample.class,JarExample$1.class) and the manifest file
in the same folder. In the command prompt, go to the folder where your files placed, and create
the jar using jar command. For example (if you name your manifest file as jexample.mf)

jar cfm jarexample.jar jexample.mf *.class

It will create executable jarexample.jar.

With the standard jar file, you have to specify the class with the main method on the command line
when running the jar. With a runnable jar, there is a manifest file that will hold that information 
so you can just type

java -jar myRunnable.jar, or simply double click it.

Note - don't want to share java files, just the class files
